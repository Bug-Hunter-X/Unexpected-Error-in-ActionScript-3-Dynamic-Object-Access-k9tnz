This repository demonstrates an uncommon error in ActionScript 3 related to dynamic object access.  The `bug.as` file contains code that reproduces the error, while `bugSolution.as` provides a solution.  The error occurs due to accessing a property of an object that may not be defined, leading to unexpected behavior or crashes. This is particularly relevant when dealing with data retrieved from external sources or user input.
